Definition - What does Neurotechnology mean?;Neurotechnology as a new prominent tech term describes any technology that helps us to understand brain function, or enables a direct connection of technology with the human nervous system.
Since the technology world has made rapid advances in both observational technology for the human brain and cognitive modeling technology in artificial intelligence, there's a grey area in terms of what constitutes neurotechnology.
;
Definition - What does Elixir mean?;Elixir is a programming language that runs on an Erlang virtual machine environment and helps to scale applications.
As a dynamic functional language utilizing a VM model, Elixir is described as a scripting language that's an alternative to using only JavaScript and Python or other interpreted languages for just-in-time compiling.
;
Definition - What does Linear Multiclass Classification mean?;Linear multiclass classification is a specific kind of targeted algorithm philosophy in machine learning and the field of structured prediction that uses both linear and multiclass methods.
A multiclass classification is used to classify more than two classes – in contrast to a binary classification.
A linear classification uses an object’s characteristics to classify it by basing a decision on the value of a linear combination of characteristics.
;
Definition - What does True Positives mean?;True positives as results in machine learning classification problems involve outputs where a test observes a positive, where a positive was also predicted.
This is part of the classical confusion matrix that engineers use as a model for discussing a classifying algorithm.
;
Definition - What does B Programming Language mean?;The B programming language is a language based on Basic Combined Programming Language or BCPL and a precursor to the C programming language (and subsequent C suite languages) that is so ubiquitous in codebase programming over the past few decades.
;
Definition - What does Reward Path mean?;In reinforcement learning, a reward path is a path that an agent takes in order to obtain cumulative rewards.
This terminology isn't really used very much on its own in machine learning, but the concept of reward is central to many machine learning algorithms and Markov decision process models.
;
Definition - What does Swift mean?;The Swift programming language is a language that Apple developed for various operating systems, including some of its smartphone operating systems, as well as desktop platforms.
It's a take on Objective-C that similarly utilizes variables to store values.
;
 Definition - What does ChatOps mean?;The phrase chatOps is used to talk about new platforms and technologies that connect work and the people that work on projects through chat interactivity.
It's a somewhat unique and new take on the idea of digital chat technology where messaging apps have allowed us to bridge various communication barriers in unprecedented ways.
;
Definition - What does Logic Programming mean?;Logic programming is a type of computer programming that is based on formal logic rules.
In a sense, logic programming corresponds to the use of mathematical equations and other logical constructs to drive programming outcomes.
;
 Definition - What does Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation mean?;Layer-wise relevance propagation is a method for understanding deep neural networks that uses a particular design path to observe how the individual layers of the program work.
These types of techniques help engineers to learn more about how neural networks do what they do, and they are crucial in combating the problem of "black box operation" in artificial intelligence, where technologies become so powerful and complex that it's hard for humans to understand how they produce results.
;
Definition - What does Neuralink mean?;Neuralink is an American company using neurotechnology to research the possibility of future innovations in high-tech neurology applications.
Neuralink has gained visibility as a project backed by Elon Musk, and as a ground-breaking way of looking at neurotech in general.

Definition - What does Neuroimaging mean?;Neuroimaging is defined as the use of "techniques to either directly or indirectly image the structure, function or pharmacology of the nervous system.
" It’s a general way to advance neuroscience through principles of observation and direct application.
It comes in many forms, from digital neural networks to direct mechanical interactive technologies.
;
Definition - What does Decision Scientist mean?;A decision scientist is a technology professional who is mainly focused on making technologies work for decision-making and enterprise.
However, the term "decision scientist" is really meaningful when you contrast it with another similar job role referred to as a "data scientist" or "big data scientist.
";
Definition - What does Control Structure mean?;A control structure is a codebase portion that supports decisions based on analysis of variables.
These functional components are eminently useful in computer science and computer programming.
;

;
Definition - What does Concurrent Computing mean?;Concurrent computing describes a process where multiple programs or threads are managed by one computing system through the process of alternating timeshared slices.
In many of these systems, it can appear that processes are being executed in parallel, but concurrent processes are little bit different than parallel computing.
;
 Definition - What does Bidirectional Search mean?;Bidirectional search is a type of search and sort activity that combines two directional approaches, so that the generator in question searches in two directions at the same time.
Using this method can decrease the amount of search activity needed to achieve a particular result.
